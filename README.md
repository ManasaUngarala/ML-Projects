# Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (leave a service) using classification models. It is based on the Telco Customer Churn dataset.

## Business Goal
Understanding customer churn helps companies take preventive action to retain customers and reduce revenue loss.
